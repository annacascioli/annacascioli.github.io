	<h2>Anna Cascioli</h2>
	 <p>I am a PhD student in the Mathematics Cluster of Excellence at the University of MÃ¼nster. I am member the research group Model Theory and Groups, working under the supervision of Katrin Tent.
	      I am also cosupervised by Shirly Geffen in the Operator Algebras group.</p>
	      <p>I am interested in geometric group theory and its intersection with operator algebras. In particular, I am trying to build new C*-simple groups from Burnside-like quotients of groups. In order to do so,
		    I am currently studying the structure of free Burnside groups through small cancellation theory and trying to extend some results to similar constructions.</p>
